The R code first loads the required libraries, dplyr and tidyverse, followed by reading in the training and test data sets, as well as the features and subject data sets. The feature names are then combined into one vector, and empty vectors are created to add columns to the y tables. The code then assigns activity labels to the levels of the y tables using a loop. The activity labels are added as a new column to the y tables and are subsequently added to the X tables. Column names are also assigned to the X tables, and a new table is created containing only the mean and standard deviation columns. Finally, two data sets are written to text files, and a table of the average values is created based on the descriptive activity and subject.
